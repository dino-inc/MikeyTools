Referred to as the 'Architects' by scholars, these beings possessed remarkable technology capable of constructing or realigning solar systems. The Corellia system, for example, appears to have been artificially constructed. These claims would seem extraordinary, but many of the Architects' machines survived the ages. The Vultar system was home to an immense 'Cosmic Turbine' that could only have been Architect technology, before misuse destroyed both the turbine and the Vultar system itself. The fabled Centerpoint Station is thought to be an Architect installation, though many species have claimed it as the work of their own people. In addition to their engineering marvels, it is believed that the Architects seeded the Core Worlds with life--particularly humans--though some attribute this to the Rakata's Infinite Empire. Despite the proof of their achievements, however, there is little evidence to suggest where the Architects came from or what eventually became of them.",

The strange, reptilian Kwa, who achieved interstellar travel through Infinity Gates that allowed them to effectively teleport between worlds, rose and mysteriously fell, eventually devolving into simple lizards.

This made the humans easy prey for the Taung, a gray-skinned species that reveled in battle. Awed by the majesty of the eruption's ash cloud, the Taung took the name 'Warriors of the Shadow,' descended on the surviving humans and subjugated them. Gradually the fighting force of the thirteen human tribes--known as the Battalions of Zhell--mustered a resistance against the Taung. After years of struggle, the Battalions managed to repel the Taung and claim their freedom. Coruscant has been the seat of humanity ever since.",

Through violence and cunning, he fought his way to become ruler of the Sith and united their nations through a bloody war. He later took the title 'Sith'ari,' meaning 'overlord.' King Adas's ascension may have been helped by an untrained Force sensitivity. Certainly Adas was long-lived; his reign lasted three hundred years, and only came to an end when the Infinite Empire launched an assault on Korriban.

Slowly, the Rakata became corrupted by their power. They began enslaving entire species, including the peoples of Coruscant. The Rakata also attacked Korriban, ruled by the great King Adas. Although their attack failed to enslave the pureblooded Sith species, King Adas was killed. Without his leadership, Korriban was plunged into civil war.

Despite this, more slave rebellions began to rise across the galaxy, forcing the Rakata to divide their forces to deal with them. A plague, perhaps created by the rebelling slaves or by Rakata dissidents, began to decimate the Rakata population. The Rakata realized that, possibly due to the plague, they were losing their connection to the Force; without it, they were cut off from their technology. The fall of the Infinite Empire, once it began, was swift. The slaves overwhelmed their Rakata overseers, who fled into the Unknown Regions of the galaxy.

The pureblooded Sith species on Korriban, having survived both the Infinite Empire's onslaught and a bloody civil war after the death of their king, also became intrigued by the machines the Rakata left behind.

Eventually, this led to the development of a hyperspace 'cannon.' These cannons allowed a ship to be propelled into hyperspace, though a second cannon was required for a ship to return to its origin point. The Core Worlds quickly established a hyperspace cannon network. The children of Coruscant soon encountered the Duros civilization, whose people became some of the earliest--and most daring--hyperspace explorers. The true colonization of the galaxy had begun.",

The Tion Cluster, an area of the Mid-Rim inhabited by the descendants of ancient sleeper ship crews, had developed a new hyperspace beacon technology based on fragments left by the Infinite Empire--far superior than the hyperspace cannons previously in use. The Tion Cluster was gradually conquered by an arrogant and powerful pirate prince, known to history as the despot Xim. Using the new hyperspace technology, he despoiled world after world, taking slaves and ruthlessly expanding his territory. His rule of the Tion Cluster lasted for thirty years and saw the conquest of hundreds of thousands of planets. Xim might have continued his rule unchallenged even longer, but he chose to expand his empire into a new area of space, one already inhabited by the powerful Hutt Empire.",

This region belonged to the Hutt Empire. Although young, the Hutt Empire had already grown immensely powerful through its criminal enterprises, helped by the long lifespan of the Hutts. The Hutts correctly assessed the threat Xim presented and poured resources into fighting him near the planet Vontor. Despite their strength, the Hutts were not certain of victory until they discovered the Si'klaata Cluster was home to several other powerful species, including the Nikto, Klatooinians, and Weequay. In a typical gambit, the Hutts managed to persuade these three species to sign the Treaty of Vontor, which bound them to the Hutts in perpetual slavery. With these additional forces, the Hutts overwhelmed Xim at the third Battle of Vontor. Xim died a Hutt prisoner, leaving his vast holdings and territory free for the taking.",

The head of the enclave, Master Haune Tiar, returned with the scouts to the allied Core Worlds. Impressed by what he saw, Master Tiar also foresaw the young Republic would need protectors.

        "description": "Trained at the Jedi Temple on Ossus centuries after the Great Hyperspace War, Freedon Nadd was a powerful but temperamental Padawan. When denied promotion to the rank of Jedi Knight, the enraged Nadd struck down his Master. He left the Jedi and began to study the powers of the dark side. Although Nadd learned much from a Sith holocron, he craved more. Nadd traveled to Yavin IV where he encountered the Massassi, savage relatives of the Sith who were once servants of Naga Sadow. Nadd defeated them, and the awestruck Massassi took him to Sadow, who rested in a suspended animation chamber. Unaware of the Sith Empire rebuilding itself on Dromund Kaas, Sadow believed Nadd was the acolyte he had been waiting for. But he underestimated Nadd's craving for power, and Nadd soon killed Sadow and left Yavin IV behind. Nadd settled on the distant world of Onderon, becoming a legendary tyrant.",

Nadd would often banish criminals beyond Iziz's walls, intending for them to die in Onderon's dangerous jungles. However, many of these criminals survived and began taming the jungle beasts as mounts. These 'Beast Riders' formed a guerrilla force that eventually went to war against Iziz. Nadd fought them fiercely, but the jungle had honed the Beast Riders into formidable enemies. The civil war continued even after Nadd's eventual death. Nadd was entombed below the city of Iziz, where his influence on Iziz's rulers would be felt for centuries.",

The argument was made that since droids had personalities and sentience, owning a droid was tantamount to slavery. The Galactic Senate dismissed the movement as a mere fad, but after millions of appeals to create a Droid Rights Bill, they were forced to address the issue. A surprising number of Senators spoke up in favor of droid rights, while many others dismissed the idea as absurd.

Republic citizens, surrounded by thousands of rogue droids--every model, from protocol to sanitation to battle units--found themselves at the mercy of their former servants. Several planets were subjugated in the name of the droid rebellion, until the signal controlling the droids was traced. Following the signal, a team of Jedi destroyed HK-01, returning the rogue droids to their original programming.

Queen Amanoa was actually a descendant of Freedon Nadd, strong in the dark side, and the Jedi were among her enemies. The queen's forces battled with those of the Beast Riders and the Jedi. Cay Qel-Droma lost his arm in the fighting, and only the arrival of Arca Jeth--who used battle meditation to turn the battle in the Jedi's favor--saved Onderon.
